The following is a list of observed values, ordered from lowest to highest: 62, 63, 63, 64, 66, 67, 68, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 72, 74, 75, 76. What is an accurate five-number summary for these data?

```{r}
question_1 <- c(62,63,63,64,66,67,68,68,70,71,72,72,74,75,76)

summary <- summary(question_1)

summary
```

**Minimum -** 62

**1st Quartile -** 65

**Median -** 68

**Mean -** 68.73

**3rd Quartile -** 72

**Maximum -** 76

### Question 2

*1 point*

Suppose that the median, Q1, and Q3 from question #1 is an accurate representation of a second (hypothetical) distribution. Based on what this information tells you about this second distribution, which of the following numbers would be a suspected outlier?

A.  76
B.  62
C.  83
D.  Both (A) and (C)
E.  All of the above
F.  None of the above, or cannot be determined from the information given.

**Answer - C. 83 is the suspected outlier.**

### Question 3

*1 point*

There is a group of three children with the following ages: 3, 4, and 5. If a 6-year-old child joins the group, what will happen to the mean and standard deviation of the group's age?

```{r}
OG_age <- c(3,4,5)

mean(OG_age)
```

```{r}
New_age <- c(3,4,5,6)

mean(New_age)
```

**Original Mean = 4 & New Mean = 4.5**

Since the mean of the group increased, the standard deviation will increase as well.

```{r}
sd(OG_age)
```

```{r}
sd(New_age)
```

**Original Standard Deviation = 1 & New Standard Deviation = 1.290994**

### Question 4

*1 point*

If I estimate an OLS regression and obtain a $R^2$ of 0.40 where the Total Sum of Squares of 4,150, what does the Residual Sum of Squares equal?

*RSS = TSS - ESS*

*ESS = R\^2 \* TSS*

*ESS = .40 \* 4,150 = 1,660*

```{r}
RSS <- 4150 - 1660

RSS
```

**Answer -** The Residual Sum of Squares equal 2490.

### Question 5

*1 point*

The distribution of some variable has a median that is smaller than its mean. Which of the following statements about the distribution's shape is most consistent with this information?

A.  The shape of the distribution would be symmetric
B.  The shape of the distribution would be skewed left
C.  The shape of the distribution would be skewed right
D.  None of the above -- cannot be determined from the information given.

**Answer -** C. The shape of the distribution would be skewed right, because its suggested that the distribution is positively skewed if the median is smaller than the mean.

The following code blocks is an example of a distribution curve with a median that is smaller than the mean. It shows that when the median is smaller, the distribution is skewed to the right.

```{r}
Ex_5 <- c(20,21,22,23,24,25,26,26,28,29,30,90)

Ex_5mean <- mean(Ex_5)
Ex_5median <- median(Ex_5)
```

Mean = 30.333 and Median = 25.5

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

Ex5_df <- data.frame(Ex_5)

ggplot(data = Ex5_df, aes(x = Ex_5)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs(title = "Number 5 Distribution Curve", x = "Value", y = "Density") +
  xlim(-20,100)
```

### Question 6

*1 point*

Suppose I want to test the hypothesis that the U.S. public's approval of the president is higher when people have more positive perceptions of the U.S. economy. To test this hypothesis, I conduct a survey of individual-level attitudes. Which of the following research design strategies should I expect to exhibit both the greatest sampling variability (in the context of repeated sampling) and the lowest degree of expected sampling bias?

A.  A random sample of 1,200 people from a list of all U.S. residential addresses
B.  A random sample of 600 people from a list of all registered students at the University of Maryland
C.  A random sample of 1,200 people from a list of all registered students at the University of Maryland
D.  A random sample of 600 people from a list of all U.S. residential addresses.'

**Answer -** A. A random sample of 1,200 people from a list of all U.S. residential addresses.

### Question 7

*1 point*

The median age of ten people in a room is 50 years. One 40-year-old person leaves the room. What can we expect will happen to the median age for the remaining nine people? Do we know the median age of those nine people; if so, what is it?

**Answer -** The median age would remain the same, because the median is the middle value. Since the ages were already sorted, the one 40-year-old leaving won't make a difference.

### Question 8

*1 point*

The mean age of ten people in a room is 50 years. One 70-years-old person leaves the room. What can we expect will happen to the mean age for the remaining nine people? Do we know the mean age of those nine people; if so, what is it?

```{r}
430/9
```

**Answer -** The mean age will decrease. The total age in the room before the 70-year-old leaves is 500 years (10 people \* 50 years). The total age goes down to 430 years when the 70-year-old leaves (500 - 70). The new mean age will then be 47.78 years (430/9).

### Question 9

*1 point*

Which of the following sets of numbers has the largest standard deviation?

A.  2, 4, 6, 8
B.  7, 8, 9, 10
C.  5, 5, 5, 5
D.  1, 2, 3, 5

```{r}
A <- c(2,4,6,8)
B <- c(7,8,9,10)
C <- c(5,5,5,5)
D <- c(1,2,3,5)
```

```{r}
sd_A <- sd(A)
sd_B <- sd(B)
sd_C <- sd(C)
sd_D <- sd(D)
```

**Answer -** A. 2, 4, 6, 8

### Question 10

*6 points*

I hypothesize that people with greater social trust are more likely to turnout to vote in American national elections. I use data from the 2012 General Social Survey to examine how respondents' self-reported level of social trust might be correlated with their decisions to vote. In particular, I use the `social_trust` variable (i.e., a 4-point ordinal indicator of social trust -- larger values reflect greater trust) and the `vote08` variable (i.e., a dichotomous indicator where a `1` indicates that the respondent voted) to test my hypothesis.

Complete the cross-tab below so that you may properly evaluate my hypothesis. Briefly interpret the results of your completed cross-tab. Do the data suggest that social trust is related to voting in 2008? Be sure to explain the nature of the relationship (or lack thereof, if relevant).

```{r}
257 + 194 + 192 + 240

137 + 93 + 56 + 30

394 + 287 + 248 + 270
```

**Total Rows:**

vote08 1 = 883

vote08 0 = 316

Total = 1199

```{r}
257 + 137 
194 + 93
192 + 56
240 + 30 
```

**Total Columns:**

Social Trust 0 = 394

Social Trust 1 = 287

Social Trust 2 = 248

Social Trust 3 = 270

**Hypothesis -** The hypothesis is correct because the percentage of people who voted with a high social trust, is higher than the percentage of who didn't vote and had low social trust. We need further evaluation to explain why there was a higher voter turnout for people with little social trust (257) versus the voter turnout percent for people with high social trust (240).

### Question 1

*10 points total*

Use the `states` dataset (the U.S. state is the unit of analysis) and estimate a bivariate regression where the size of a state's urban population (`urban`) explains variation in abortion attitudes (`permit`) and report the results in a professionally formatted table. The variable `permit` measures the percentage (on a 0-to-100 scale) of a state's population that says abortion should always be allowed. The variable `urban` measures the percentage (on a 0-to-100 scale) of a state's population in an urban area. Answer the following questions.

```{r}
abortion <- lm(permit ~ urban, data = states)

abortion

modelsummary::modelsummary(abortion,
             statistic = NULL,
             coef_rename = c("urban" = "Urban population in 2000 (percentage)"),
             gof_map = "nobs"
             )
```

A.  Interpret the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable. *2 points*

    ```{r}
    summary(abortion)
    ```

    **Answer -** The positive coefficient indicates that the when there was an increase in a state's urban population, there is also an increase in the percentage of the population that says abortion should be allowed.

    ```{r}
    ggplot(states, aes(x=urban, y=permit)) +
      geom_point() +
      labs(x = "Urban population in 2000 (percentage)", y = "View on abortion allowance (percentage)") +
      theme_minimal()
    ```

B.  Interpret the estimate of the intercept. Is it substantively meaningful to interpret this coefficient on its own? Explain why, or why not. *2 points*

    **Answer -** If the urban population in 2000 was 0 percent, the predicted percentage of those who believe that abortion should always be allowed would 9.63943. It is not substantively meaning to interpret the estimate coefficient on its own because it isn't in the range of values in my data. For instance, the percentages for the state's population that believes abortion should always be permitted starts at 20 in the data.

C.  Compute the residual sum of squares for the following two observations combined: (1) California; and (2) Texas. *2 points*

    ```{r}
    abortion
    tidy(abortion)

    abortion_regress <- tidy(abortion)

    augment(abortion)
    ```

    ```{r}
    beta_0 <- abortion_regress |>
      filter(term == "(Intercept)") |>
      pull(estimate)

    beta_0
    ```

    ```{r}
    beta_1 <- abortion_regress |>
      filter(term == "urban") |>
      pull(estimate)

    beta_1
    ```

    ```{r}
    ?state
    states |>
      filter(stateid%in%c("CA    ", "TX    ")) |>
      select(stateid, urban)
    ```

    ```{r}
    beta_0 + beta_1 *82.5
    ```

    The predicted value of Texas is 40.43313.

    ```{r}
    beta_0 + beta_1 *94.4
    ```

    The predicted value of California is 44.87489.

    The observed values for California is 94.4 and for Texas is 82.5

    ```{r}
    94.4 - 44.8

    82.5 - 40.43
    ```

    The residual value for California is 49.52 and for Texas is 42.07.

D.  How well does the model fit the data (i.e., how well can we explain abortion attitudes with this model?) *2 points*

    ```{r}
    glance(abortion) |>
      select(r.squared)
    ```

E.  Is the relationship between the independent and dependent variable causal? Why or why not? *2 points*

    Is not a causal, but it is a positive correlation relationship. When the urban population increases, so does the percentage of the population in states that believe abortion should always be allowed.

### Question 2

*5 points*

Use the `gss` data set (the unit of analysis is the individual survey respondent) and evaluate the hypothesis that Republicans had less confidence in the executive branch of the federal government than Democrats in 2016. Use the following variables: `partyid` is a 7-category ordinal indicator (0 = Strong Democrat; 1 = Weak Democrat; 2 = Independent Democrat; 3 = Independent; 4 = Independent Republican; 5 = Weak Republican; 6 = Strong Republican); and `confed` is a 3-category ordinal indicator (1 = "a great deal" of confidence; 2 = "only some;" 3 = "hardly any"). Do the data support the hypothesis and how do you know?

```{r}
library(modelsummary) 

datasummary_crosstab(partyid ~ confed, data = gss)
```

**Hypothesis -** The hypothesis is supported based on the crosstab.

While 19.9% of strong Democrats had a great deal of confidence in the the executive branch of the federal government, only 3.1% of strong Republicans had a great deal of confidence. Also, when it comes to having hardly any confidence in the executive branch of the federal government, 41.1% of strong Republicans felt this way while only 14.9% of strong Democrats displayed low confidence.

Since more strong Republicans associated their confidence level with the executive branch of the federal government as the lowest possible level (hardly any) than strong Democrats, and less strong Republicans claimed they had a great deal of confidence than strong Democrats, this hypothesis is supported.

### Question 3

*5 points*

Use the `world` dataset and evaluate the distributions for each the following variables: `literacy` (a country's literacy rate) and `free_overall` (a country's degree of economic freedom). Be sure to visually display each distribution and thoroughly describe their key attributes. Next, evaluate the bivariate relationship between the two variables -- i.e., is economic freedom associated with literacy? If so, what is the nature of the relationship and how do you know? In doing so, be sure to use proper descriptive tools (and thus do not rely simply on a regression output).

```{r}
lit <- world |>
  group_by(literacy) |>
  summarize(count =n())

ggplot(lit, aes(x = literacy, y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Countries Literacy Rate", x = "Country's Literacy Rate", y = "Frequency") + theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
free <- world |>
  group_by(free_overall) |>
  summarize(count = n())

ggplot(free, aes(x = free_overall, y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fil = "lightblue") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Countries Degree of Freedom", x = "Country's Degree of Freedom", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
ggplot(world, aes(x = literacy)) +
  geom_density(fill = "lightblue", color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Density Plot of Literacy Rate",
       x = "Literacy Rate",
       y = "Density") +
  xlim(20, 120)

```

```{r}
ggplot(world, aes(x = free_overall)) +
  geom_density(fill = "purple", color = "pink") +
  labs(title = "Density Plot of Economic Freedom",
       x = "Economic Freedom",
       y = "Density") +
  xlim(20, 110)
```

**Description of Key Attributes -**

In the density plot that visualizes the literacy rate of countries, the distribution is right-skewed. The distribution being right-skewed indicates that the most of the countries have high literacy rates, but there's a peak of countries that have an even higher values. From 20 to 75, it shows that there are some countries with lower literacy rates.

In the density plot that visualizes the economic freedom of countries, it shows a normal distribution since the scores of economic freedom are evenly spread. However, there's a small tail of countries that have low levels of economic freedom.

```{r}
regress_litFree <- lm(literacy ~ free_overall, data = world)

summary(regress_litFree)

modelsummary::modelsummary(regress_litFree,
             statistic = NULL,
             coef_rename = c("free_overall" = "Economic freedom"),
             gof_map = "nobs"
             )
```

The positive coefficient of 33.0781 indicates a positive relationship between the literacy rates and economic freedom.

```{r}
ggplot(world, aes(x = literacy, y = free_overall)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Literacy vs. Economic Freedom",
       x = "Literacy Rate",
       y = "Economic Freedom")
```

This scatterplot has a weak positive correlation, because there is a general positive trend, but a cluster forms showing a higher correlation. The cluster in the scatterplot indicates that when a country has a higher score of economic freedom that country also has a higher literacy rate.
